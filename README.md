# Node with React: Fullstack Web Development

Gave my own personal touch and started using hooks and instead of using Passport with Google Strategy, I used Facebook Strategy.

Used [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) as the mailing service.

The project proposes ReduxForm for form validation, but since I started working with hooks, I tried to find an alternate solution. Then I found [React-Hook-Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) which is super easy to use and less painful than wiring up ReduxForm.
With ReduxForm you have the form data at a global level, and there's no need of that.

For UI, I used [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) which is a CSS framework based on Material Design.
